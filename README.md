TinyUnixTimestap is a tiny program. All it does is this:

1. It adds a system tray icon which, when clicked, copies the current Unix timestamp to your clipboard.
2. Right-clicking its tray icon brings up a menu with one option: "Exit".

I've found it useful in the past. Perhaps you'll find it useful, too.

If you don't want to compile it yourself, there's a compiled executable in [the TinyUnixTimestamp/bin/Release directory of this project](https://github.com/BenMakesGames/TinyUnixTimestamp/tree/master/TinyUnixTimestamp/bin/Release).

Pro tip: if you want TinyUnixTimestamp to run on system startup, drop a shortcut to it (or even the executable itself) into your "Startup" folder. _(Yeah! The one in the Start menu! You probably forgot about it, but it's still there, and it's still good!)_
